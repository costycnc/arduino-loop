create a loop for nativity scene
I try to create a program for arduino , for example , the user have many steppers motors mounted at your nativity scene , and need programmed the movement easy , i supose that user not have any knowledge about arduino and programming.
All that need to know the user... is to know use a serial monitor ... because i suppose that user is already a user of costycnc foam cuter ( www.costycnc.it ) and is accustomed with gcodesender from chrome ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gcode-sender/ngncibnakmabjlfpadjagnbdjbhoelom ) the user can use this serial monitor to send commands to arduino.
The first program have 3 value that command speed of stepper motor any second and repeat ... with time i insert new functions ... this is the first test!
enjoy!
